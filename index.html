      When asked about what is it I am looking to acomplish in my Career as a
      Developer, I sat and wondered, make hundreads of thousands of dollars,
      become the head of some tech company, or even just live a simple life as a
      everyday 9-5 software engineer. What I strive to becom as a Top teir
      Software Engineer is to make innovative tech that pushes the bounds of
      what we know as reality just as the Wright brothers did with the limits of
      flight and as einstine has done with the fabrics of reality. Now, whether
      that can be accomlished with your company or not that is what I am
      expecting to find out. But in the event that it is not attinable ith your
      company, I look forward to seeing you on the front as a Competitor.
